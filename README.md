# Email-Sender-App-by-me
These are the files for my newly made up first app using python that supports user Interface GUI using PYQT5


the create file option will help you create a csv file as a Dictionary using this as a header ["username","adress"]
it will create a temporary file where it saves the currently added users by you when you're done you press save and select destination that's when the app will create the real file and move all the temporary saved data to the target file and clean the temporaray file


the edit file option will help you edit your file add remove edit !! 
adding new users to a file will have a strict requirements !! name must not exist twice in the same file and must have a space !! that means full username !! as for adress it follows the universal pattern !! 
Edit have 2 options : edit name which will use email as a search method and modify the name related to that email 
                      edit email which will use name as a search method and modify the email realated to that name


to use the send optino you need to select a file or it won't proceed !! [you can select multiple files as inputs]

in the send screen you have the subject the the content and you can attach photos and pdf files only currently !! more features in next updates !! 


that's it I hope you enjoy using my app and Leave me some comments for upgrades !!
